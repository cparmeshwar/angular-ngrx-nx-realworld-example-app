title: Introduction

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully-fledged, full-stack application built with [Angular](https://angular.dev/), [ngrx/signals](https://ngrx.io/guide/signals) and [nrwl/nx](https://nx.dev/). It includes CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more. It is an implementation of the [RealWorld apps](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) project, which aims to show how the same "real-world" app can be built using different technologies on the front-end and back-end.

This specific implementation was created in 2017 and is constantly updated to the latest versions of Angular, utilizing most of the features of the modern Angular era. You can help us maintain this project in various ways; find out how in the [How to contribute](../how-to-contribute).

Check the [next](./features) section to see how this app works, which features are included, and how they are connected to the architecture decisions made during development.

For more information on how this works with other front-ends/back-ends, head over to the [RealWorld apps](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
