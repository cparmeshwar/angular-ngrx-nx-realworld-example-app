title: Introduction

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Angular](https://angular.dev/), [ngrx/signals](https://ngrx.io/guide/signals), [nrwl/nx](https://nx.dev/) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more. It is an implementation of the [RealWorld apps](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) project. The purpose of the `RealWorld apps` project is to demonostrate how you can build the same "realworld" app using different technologies in the front-end and on the back-end.

This specific implementation was created in 2017 and it is constantly migrated to the latest versions of Angular and it utilizes most of the features of the Modern Angular era. You can help us to maintain this project in various ways. You can find some of them in the [how to contribute]() guide. 

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
